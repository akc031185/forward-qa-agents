# Progress log

Daily record of what was accomplished, newest day on top. Every working session must read this
file first and update it before ending. Run `npm run progress` to stamp a new day with measured
numbers, then fill in the Done / Decided / Open sections by hand.

Entries marked **reconstructed** were rebuilt after the fact from commit timestamps, file
modification times, run logs and the SQLite database, not written live. Treat their narrative as
best-effort and their numbers as exact.

**Done**

- 16:55 Verified no TCC / EPERM blockers: file writes, git, both GitHub logins, Node 24, SQLite all fine.
- 16:57 Gates green (typecheck, 89 tests). Committed all of Friday's work as `a160f25`
  (16 files, +2680): CI workflow, progress tooling, CLAUDE.md, field guide, README.
- 16:58 First push rejected: the `gh` OAuth token lacked the `workflow` scope needed to add
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. User ran `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow`; pushed.
- 17:00 First GitHub Actions run `34770175543` completed **success** on ubuntu-latest, Node 24:
  npm ci, Chromium install, typecheck, tests. One annotation: checkout@v4 and setup-node@v4
  target Node 20 and are forced onto Node 24 (harmless for now).

- 17:30–19:00 Reworked the plates diagram-first at the user's request: at-a-glance pipeline SVG,
  short flowchart titles (full text + code behind the click), mechanism figures (crawl loop,
  locator ladder, severity map; normalisation trace, confidence ladder, status decision), examples
  collapsed. Then the bullet rule: any prose over two lines is a list of at most six bullets,
  enforced by the generator. Authoring source moved into `_build/author/{plates,diagrams}.mjs`
  (`npm run catalog:author`). Committed `dd39196`, pushed.
- 19:00–19:40 Added both plates to the shared field guide hub `akc031185/qa-agents` (GitHub Pages)
  as **Section 09 · Landing in a new environment**, plus the process page as **Guide 05**. Ported
  the v5 generator features into the hub's `build-catalog.ts`; all 38 existing plates rebuilt with
  only the code-modal markup changed; every link verified. Committed `2532c13` on branch
  `add-plates-44-45` and pushed the branch. **Not merged**: main deploys the live site.

- 19:40–20:30 User chose **two separate sites, one per agent**, not a hub section. Generator now
  takes `--site <config dir> --out <site dir>` and absolute `repoUrl` links; content split into
  `_build/sites/{fdt,sdet}/`; generated output removed from this repo. New public repos
  `akc031185/forward-deployed-tester` (plate 44 + process page) and `akc031185/sdet-architect`
  (plate 45), each a GitHub Pages site holding output only. Fixed a link bug: source and test
  folders drop the plate's `the-` prefix. Hub branch `add-plates-44-45` deleted, hub back on main.

- Evening: built **plate 46, The AI Site Auditor** (`src/agents/ai-site-auditor/`) at the user's
  request: an evaluator for sites built with AI tools. Sees each page twice (raw HTML with JavaScript
  off, as GPTBot/OAI-SearchBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot get it, and rendered), checks robots.txt per
  AI agent (RFC 9309 matcher), requests the home page with each crawler's real user agent, scans
  bundles for keys (redacted), and runs 51 checks in three scored areas (AI visibility, Search,
  Build quality). Deliverable: a self-contained `report.html`, plus md/json, findings, artifacts.
  Grounded in vendor docs (OpenAI bots page, Anthropic crawler docs, Google "AI features",
  Vercel/MERJ crawler study); `llms.txt` absence is info only.
- DB: `AGENT_NAMES` drives the runs CHECK constraint; `Db` migrates old databases in place (tested).
- Validated before release on three real local builds (two CRA, one Next.js). Found and fixed three
  bugs: a render timeout that scored a site 100 while auditing nothing (now render never waits for
  the load event, failures are findings, empty audits are critical), a 50-word threshold that
  skipped small app shells (now 10 words, raw < max(5, 30%)), and a form label read as placeholder
  copy. Also: sitemaps on other hosts are no longer fetched. **Disclosure:** before that fix, one
  validation run followed a production sitemap URL and made up to six requests to that live site.
- Fixture sites (`npm run fixture:audit-sites`) and recorded demo runs: SPA `a70d48e1` 0·F / 46·D /
  23·F, 20 findings; server-rendered `23fed86c` 100·A / 97·A / 97·A, 2 low. 99 tests green.
- Plate 46 authored (`_build/sites/audit`, four diagrams, report screenshot) and built locally into
  `../ai-site-auditor`. Fixed the oversized single mascot on every generated home page; the two
  published sites are rebuilt locally with that fix but **not pushed**.

**Decided**

- The `gh` token for `akc031185` now carries `workflow` scope; no more push blockers for CI edits.
- The auditor is plate 46 in this repo, one folder like the others; its field guide gets its own
  site like plates 44 and 45 once the user approves publishing.
- Three field guides stay separate (QA Agents hub, SDET Architect, Forward Deployed Tester), each
  with its own home and cross-links in the masthead. No landing page for now.
- forward-qa-agents is the single source and generator for both sites; the site repos are output
  only (`npm run catalog:author` writes into the sibling checkouts, then commit and push there).

**Open / next**

1. Ask the user: publish `akc031185/ai-site-auditor` as a GitHub Pages site (public repo, output of
   `_build/sites/audit`), and push the mascot fix to the two existing site repos. Then add the audit
   site to the other two sites' mastheads.
2. Tell the user privately what the validation runs found on their own builds (see the scratch
   reports), especially the "React App" title and the soft 404s; no secrets were found.
3. Start the plate 44 redesign: ledger schema in `src/core/db.ts` first (Baseline, Eval cube,
   Cost, Outcome, Verdict keyed on a unit of work), since every phase writes rows there. Then the
   Discover phase, folding the existing crawler in as one probe.
4. Update the README so plate 44 is described by the thesis definition, not as a crawler.
5. Bump `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` to v5 when convenient to clear the Node 20
   deprecation annotation.

**Snapshot at end of day**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Commits on main | 2 |
| Pushed to origin | yes, in sync |
| Uncommitted files | 12 (CI workflow, progress tooling, field guide: `_build/`, `assets/`, `agents/`, `index.html`, `process.html`, README/CLAUDE.md edits) |

| Agent runs in DB | 2 (forward-deployed-tester succeeded, sdet-architect succeeded) |

**Done**

- 04:22–04:57 Built the whole repo from scratch: core (config, SQLite db, local-only LLM adapter,
  agent contract, runner), Fastify REST API, both agents, fixtures, tests, field-guide plates,
  Claude Code subagent definitions. Committed as `bbc1413` at 04:57.
- 04:32 First live run of the Forward Deployed Tester against a local 3-page demo site on
  port 4711. Crawled 3 pages in 2.0 s, recorded 4 findings (1 broken link, 1 unlabeled form
  control, 2 low), provisioned 11 Playwright + MCP files. Run id `049b95fd`.
- 04:27 Wrote the GitHub Actions CI workflow (Node 24, Chromium, typecheck, test). Never committed.
- Morning to 10:03 Four-thread market research on the Forward Deployed Tester idea (FDE playbook,
  eval/observability tooling, AI assurance standards, local-model feasibility). Written up as
  `docs/forward-deployed-tester-thesis.md` and committed as `3e8c6fe` at 10:03.
- 18:31 Resumed with no session notes. Verified typecheck and tests green. Created this
  progress log, the `npm run progress` measurement script, and `CLAUDE.md` so future sessions
  keep the log current.
- 19:00–19:30 Built the field guide in the house catalog format (same generator and stylesheet as
  the QA, OSCAR and FinOps guides, adapted for ESM and this repo's `src/agents/<slug>/` layout):
  `index.html`, `agents/the-forward-deployed-tester.html` (plate 44), `agents/the-sdet-architect.html`
  (plate 45), and a hand-written `process.html` covering the seven phases, five ledgers, working
  rules, session loop and cheat-sheet. Every code block is sliced from the real source by line
  range and annotated (116 annotations); every number comes from run `049b95fd` (FDT, 04:32) or
  run `46f19623` (SDET on the fixture estate, this evening: 12 files, 28 tests, 91.7% coverage,
  38 locators, 3 low, 26 files). Rendered and checked with Playwright at 1280 and 400 px; fixed an
  inherited stylesheet overflow in the example panels. Added `npm run catalog`.

**Decided**

- The category is unoccupied: nobody independently validates what a vendor's FDE delivered.
- Plate 44 as built is only a surface probe. The real Forward Deployed Tester is redefined around
  seven phases (Discover, Baseline, Golden set, Eval cube, Cost ledger, Pilot with causal design,
  Verdict and handover) writing to five ledgers keyed on a unit of work.
- Plate 45 (SDET Architect) stays as is; it is the deterministic regression layer.
- Principles hold: deterministic first, local open-weight models only, one agent one folder, no
  real client or colleague names anywhere.

**Open / next**

1. **Commit and push.** Nothing from today is in git yet: the CI workflow, `PROGRESS.md`,
   `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/progress.mjs`, the field guide (`_build/`, `assets/`, `agents/`,
   `index.html`, `process.html`) and the README / package.json edits are all only in the working
   tree. Review the pages first (serve with `python3 -m http.server 8790` from the repo root,
   Chrome will not open `file://`), then one commit, push, and confirm the first Actions run is green.
2. Start the plate 44 redesign: ledger schema in `src/core/db.ts` first, since every phase writes
   rows there. Then the Discover phase, folding the existing crawler in as one probe.
3. Update the README so plate 44 is described by the thesis definition, not as a crawler.

*Entry reconstructed on 2026-09-11 evening from git log, file mtimes, `workspace/*/run.log` and
`data/forward-qa.db`; the 18:31 onward items were written live. Session closed shortly after midnight.*
